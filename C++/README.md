C++ Tutorial
=============

# Running tutorials
Each tutorial folder has subfolders containing source files that can be compiled and
  run with `run.sh` as
```bash
../run.sh file.cpp
# OR
./run.sh
```
If there is a `run.sh` file in the subfolder, that is preferred over the generic
one in the top level folder. It usually compiles in a specific way and produces
specific outputs.
