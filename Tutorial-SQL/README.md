# Big Picture
Structured Query Language (SQL) is a domain-specific language (DSL) used for
managing data in a relational database management system (RDBMS). Relational
databases are one of several database models. Database models specify a logical
structure for storing, organizing, and manipulating data. Relational databases
focus on organizing data as tables and relations between those tables. SQL,
then, is the language by which programmers manage tables in a relational
databases. When data is not best organized into tables, it is worth considering
other database models.

SQL is defined by an ISO and ANSI standard and relational databases follow core
theoretical ideas but there exist several concrete implementations of RDBMS with
their own corresponding SQL dialect. Popular implementations include SQLite,
PostgreSQL, Oracle, MSSQL, and MySQL. Each sticks more or less closely to the
core standards and principles but often deviate in a few ways.
