To make sure doxygen is installed correctly and you understand the basics, run the following in this directory when it is empty:

```bash
doxygen -g
doxygen Doxyfile
```
To view the auto-generated html page, open `html/index.html` with your browser of choice

To view the autogenerated latex documents, run
```bash
cd latex
make
open refman.pdf
```

The project will be given the default name "My Project"
There is no code to document so all the resulting documentation should be empty except for text from this README.

To clear this directory for rerunning the steps above, delete all other files with
```bash
rm -rf Doxyfile html/ latex/
```
